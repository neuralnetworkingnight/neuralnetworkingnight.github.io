      <description>Institut de l&amp;rsquo;Audition&#xA;Feedforward propagation along the mouse auditory pathway How spikes propagate along multiple layer networks has been extensively studied with computational models. Feedforward networks are a prominent model able to transmit information rapidly, but these networks have been difficult to isolate in the intact mammalian brain. Here, we focus on the auditory network which is characterized by multiple connected relays. We used sound and optogenetic stimulations to drive the auditory periphery and monitored neuronal activity at two locations along the auditory pathway simultaneously, using large-scale electrophysiological recordings.</description>

      <description>ESPCI Paris&#xA;The role of bodily feedback in prefrontal regulation of fear states We have all introspectively sampled the tie between our body and our emotions and multiple lines of evidence demonstrate the tight correlations between brain–body interactions and affective states. However, the question of the specificity and causality of this link has remained unresolved since it was first epitomized by the historical James-Cannon debate. In the past few years, the possibility of manipulating bodily feedback in the mouse has driven insight into the underlying physiological mechanisms from multiple labs [1-3].</description>

      <description>École Normale Supérieure, Meta AI&#xA;AI and the Brain: the unexpected similarities and the remaining differences As AI systems now generate plausible texts and images, one may wonder whether these machines process information similarly to us. In this talk, we will discuss how this question is scientifically approached in the new field of &amp;lsquo;Neuro-AI&amp;rsquo;. The experimental results in the past decade highlight unexpected similarities, whereby computer vision algorithms learn to transform images through a hierarchy of representations that map onto the visual hierarchy in our cortex, and where a similar convergence can also be observed with large language models.</description>

      <description>INCC, Université Paris Cité&#xA;Traveling Waves in Human Brain Neural oscillations have been observed across scales, species and recording methods. Recently, researchers have focused on their spatial organization across the cortex. Traveling Waves patterns, specifically, correspond to monotonic phase shifts in the direction of signal propagation and appear to play a role in cognitive functions. Identifying spatio-temporally consistent patterns, however, in non-invasively obtained human data (EEG or MEG recordings) poses significant technical challenges, such as source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios, which complicate the interpretation of cortical activity from surface sensor measurements.</description>

      <description>Institut des Neurosciences Paris‑Saclay&#xA;The Mouse Primary Visual Cortex: Where Vision Meets Motion Many of the sensory organs that enable us to perceive the world around us are located on our head, for example, the eyes. To accurately represent our surroundings, sensory systems in the brain must combine their primary source of sensory information, e.g. visual signals, with information about head movements in space. The vestibular organs, located in the inner ear, provide this information by transforming head motion into neural signals.</description>

      <description>Institut du Fer-à-Moulin&#xA;Neural mechanisms for emotional memory processing during sleep The gradual reinforcement of memories, called “consolidation”, is a process occurring partially during sleep and mediated by various patterns of coordinated neural activity. The formation of contextualized emotional memories involves a large network of structures, among which the hippocampus and the baso-lateral amygdala (BLA) are central. In the dorsal hippocampus, fast oscillations (sharp-wave ripples) during non-REM sleep mediate the consolidation of spatial memories through the reactivation of place cell activity.</description>

      <description>Vision Institute&#xA;Predicting visual neural responses: can we make better use of less data? How do sensory neurons respond to our surroundings? To answer this, we can train deep neural network models on recorded visual neuron responses (e.g., to presented movies/images), to predict responses to new stimuli. Performance is often limited by the data: the longer the recordings, the better the predictions; with short recordings, current models often fail. This is a problem since experiments are hard, and data often limited.</description>

      <description>Institut Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique - ISIR&#xA;Sensorimotor coordination of balance The agility of humans and other animals relies on their ability to maintain balance during movement. This is a complex task requiring the integration of neurophysiology and biomechanics. In this talk, I show that young healthy adults use simple control strategies to maintain balance during standing and walking. Moreover, when standing and walking on the hands, gymnasts employ the same biomechanical strategies for balance.</description>
