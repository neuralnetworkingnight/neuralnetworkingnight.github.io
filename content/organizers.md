##  __Who organizes Neural Networking Night?__

The overarching goal of our team is to understand how neural populations represent behavior and change over learning, using mathematical modelling and through development of data-driven methods. 

We currently have openings - contact [Alex](mailto:natasha.cayco.gajic@ens.fr) if you are interested in joining the team!
