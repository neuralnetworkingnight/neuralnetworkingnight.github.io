## Neural Networking Night

Neural Networking Night establishes a platform for regular interactions and dialogue within the Ile-de-France Systems and Computational Neuroscience community. We propose an innovative and engaging project where a scientific seminar meets social interaction, the “Neural Networking Night”: Elevate the understanding of the brain in a social setting at a Neuroscience Seminar in “Le Piano Vache” pub (8 Rue Laplace, 75005 Paris), an iconic student pub in the academic 5th arrondissement. The idea is to provide a platform for Systems and Computational Neuroscientists across institutions of the Ile-de-France region to interact informally and share cutting-edge research findings. The concept of a scientific seminar in a pub would offer an engaging opportunity to disseminate preliminary findings, gather scientists of all career stages, spark conversations that could become future collaborations, and consolidate the Systems and Computational Neuroscience community across the region.
