Since 2020, I am a postdoc with Alex Cayco Gajic at the Group for Neural Theory. Before that, I obtained my PhD from the Universitat de Barcelona, Spain, where I worked with Albert Compte to understand how NMDA receptor dysfunction affects working memory by altering prefrontal attractor dynamics.

In my postdoc, I am diving into the fields of motor learning and naturalistic behavior, the cerebellum, and how the cerebellum interacts with the neocortex to guide behavior and learning. In my research, I am using and developing statistical methods to analyze behavior and task-related neural population dynamics as animals are learning new skills.
