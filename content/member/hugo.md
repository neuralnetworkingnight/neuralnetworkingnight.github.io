I am a Ph.D. in the Group for Neural Theory at ENS in Paris under the joint supervision of [Alex Cayco Gajic](https://sites.google.com/view/caycogajic/home) and [Jonathan Kadmon](https://www.neuro-theory.org/home).

My work focuses on the dynamics of learning in biologically plausible neural networks. I'm particularly interested in the Hebbian dynamics of learning, its involvement in representational drift and potential applications to AI systems.
