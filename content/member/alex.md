I am a Junior Professor in the Departement D’Etudes Cognitives at ENS. My formal training lies squarely in applied mathematics, and I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Eric Shea Brown](https://faculty.washington.edu/etsb/) at the University of Washington. Throughout my PhD I became increasingly interested in neuroscience, and wanted to learn more about the kinds of questions that were important to experimental neuroscientists. For my postdoc, I decided to join Angus Silver’s [Angus Silver](https://silverlab.org/)'s lab at UCL, where I began to focus on the cerebellar circuit while working closely with the experimentalists in his team.

In 2019 I started my own lab at ENS, where I integrate these approaches to interrogate cerebellar function using a wide variety of quantitative methods across modelling and data analysis (in close collaboration with my experimental collaborators). I am particularly interested in extending (or breaking?) the classic view of the cerebellum as a forward model to understand its interactions with the neocortex and basal ganglia, both for motor coordination and cognition (and everything in between).
