I am a Ph.D. in the Group for Neural Theory at ENS in Paris. I am currently working on probing the cerebello-cortical 
loop during motor learning and behavior through mMachine learning and mathematical techniques.<br>
Previously, I was a research assistant in the group of [Andrea Calimera](https://eda.polito.it/andrea-calimera/), EDA, 
Politecnico di Torino, working in machine learning techniques application on predictive maintenance in the MADEin4 and 
R3-PowerUP european projects, and on development of neural network properties verification algorithms.

I am interested in understanding general principles underlying both biological and artificial learning.
