I am a PhD student at the Group for Neural Theory at [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris . 
I have interests at the interface of Computational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence. 

I performed my bachelor internship in the laboratory of 
[Luca Berdondini](https://www.iit.it/web/microtechnology-for-neuroelectronics) at 
[Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it/) on large-scale neural recordings, spike sorting, and clustering. 
My master thesis focused on stochastic gradient descent methods for training recurrent neural networks inspired by 
biological findings under the supervision of [Vincent Hakim](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~hakim/) at 
[LPENS](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/). 

I am currently working on the relations between cerebellum, basal ganglia, and reinforcement learning.
