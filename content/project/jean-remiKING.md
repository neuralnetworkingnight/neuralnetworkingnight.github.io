## AI and the Brain: the unexpected similarities and the remaining differences

As AI systems now generate plausible texts and images, one may wonder whether these machines process information similarly to us. In this talk, we will discuss how this question is scientifically approached in the new field of 'Neuro-AI'. The experimental results in the past decade highlight unexpected similarities, whereby computer vision algorithms learn to transform images through a hierarchy of representations that map onto the visual hierarchy in our cortex, and where a similar convergence can also be observed with large language models. Far from anecdotal, these results suggest the existence of general principles that structure information processing in intelligent systems, should they be biological or artificial.
