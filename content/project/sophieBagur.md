## The role of bodily feedback in prefrontal regulation of fear states

We have all introspectively sampled the tie between our body and our emotions and multiple lines of
evidence demonstrate the tight correlations between brain–body interactions and affective states.
However, the question of the specificity and causality of this link has remained unresolved since it
was first epitomized by the historical James-Cannon debate. In the past few years, the possibility of
manipulating bodily feedback in the mouse has driven insight into the underlying physiological
mechanisms from multiple labs [1-3].

I will share our work investigating in mice how specific breathing-driven oscillations underlie specific
states of fear and causally contribute to their regulation. During fear-related freezing, regular
breathing entrains the olfactory bulb which in turn transmits this rhythm to the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex where it organizes neural activity. Blocking the feedback of the respiratory rhythm
to the brain reduces mice’s ability to maintain prolonged states of freezing. Moreover we observed
that breathing rate, as well as other bodily parameters, are heterogenous despite identical freezing
behaviour and can “encode” threat proximity. Our analysis of prefrontal cortex neural activity shows
that these neurons respond to specific breathing rates, thus displaying possible “interoceptive tuning
curves”. I will discuss the possibility that this provides a mechanism to readout emotional state from
bodily feedback.
