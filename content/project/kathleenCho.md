## Prefontal interneuron function in cognitive control

Rhythmic neural activity is thought to play a key role in the function of neural circuits, and within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), gamma oscillations have been associated with higher cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and cognitive control. Gamma oscillations in the PFC are mediated by a specific class of inhibitory interneurons that can be identified based on either their fast-spiking electrophysiological properties or expression of calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. Although synchronization is common in neural systems, its functional significance remains controversial. I will present how synchronization in prefrontal parvalbumin interneurons contributes to cognitive flexibility.
