## Dissection of a fear memory engram

How does the brain decide which experiences become lasting memories? Understanding how neurons select, encode, and consolidate information is a central question in neuroscience. In my laboratory, we explore how associative memories are formed and stored within neural networks.

Using cutting-edge techniques to tag neurons based on their calcium activity with unprecedented temporal precision, we uncovered distinct, non-overlapping ensembles of dorsal CA1 neurons that are selectively activated during different phases of fear memory acquisition. By mapping these neurons to specific behavioral events and salient stimuli, we found that the timing of neuronal engagement is critical: neurons active at particular moments are not just involved in learning—they are sufficient to drive memory expression.
We further identified the core “engram” cells that are essential for memory formation and recall.

In this talk, I will highlight the distinct identities and functions of these neuronal ensembles, reveal how they orchestrate the transformation of experience into memory, and discuss broader implications for understanding how the brain selects which information is stored long-term. These findings shed new light on the fundamental principles of memory formation and open avenues for exploring how experiences shape the brain.
