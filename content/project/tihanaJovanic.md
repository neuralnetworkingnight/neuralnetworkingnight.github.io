## Neural circuit mechanisms of flexible sensorimotor decisions

Animals respond to their environment differently depending on the environmental context or their internal state. Thus the implementation of the processes underlying behavioral selection needs to be flexible to allow information about the changes in the environment as well as the information about internal needs to influence the selection of behavior at any given moment. I will in this talk present our work that sheds light on the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the context/state-dependent modulation of sensorimotor decisions at multiple levels from molecules to neural circuits and behavior using Drosophila larva as a model.
