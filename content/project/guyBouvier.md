## The Mouse Primary Visual Cortex: Where Vision Meets Motion

Many of the sensory organs that enable us to perceive the world around us are
located on our head, for example, the eyes. To accurately represent our
surroundings, sensory systems in the brain must combine their primary source of
sensory information, e.g. visual signals, with information about head movements in
space. The vestibular organs, located in the inner ear, provide this information by
transforming head motion into neural signals. Unlike other senses, however, these
head motion signals are not processed by a dedicated cortical area, but are instead
broadcast throughout the brain. We have previously demonstrated that neurons in
primary sensory areas such as the primary visual cortex (V1) robustly respond to
head movements, even in the absence of visual stimuli. However, in contrast to our
thorough understanding of the pathways that convey visual signals to V1, our
knowledge relative to the sources of head movement signals to V1, and both the
local processing and the nature of these signals, is still very rudimentary. In this
seminar, we will address these knowledge gaps by exploring how head movements
affect V1 neuronal activity and investigating the potential sources and characteristics
of these signals. By exploring these mechanisms, we aim to enhance our
understanding of how vestibular signals are processed in a primarily visual area of
the cortex. This is a crucial step towards our ultimate goal of understanding the
neuronal circuits and computations underlying visual processing during self-motion,
thereby providing new insights into how we sense the world.
