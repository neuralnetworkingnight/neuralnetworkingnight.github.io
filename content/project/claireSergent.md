## Neural dynamics of conscious perception

Even when we are awake, some of the external stimuli that we receive, be they visual, auditory, tactile etc… remain unconscious. What difference does it make in our brain when we perceive a stimulus consciously versus not ? I will present studies using neuroimaging techniques in awake adults that allow us to understand the neural mechanisms associated with conscious versus non conscious perception of the same external stimulus. I will present models that help us understand the dynamics associated with these different types of information processing. Finally, I will show how this knowledge could be used for diagnosing consciousness in non-communicating patients.
