## Healing psychiatric disorders with psychedelics? A neuroscience perspective

Psychedelics are experiencing a renaissance in neuroscience and psychiatry, with growing evidence that these compounds can produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects across multiple psychiatric disorders. Acting primarily as serotonergic agonists, psychedelics induce profound functional brain alterations while enhancing neuroplasticity. These neural effects translate into clinical benefits, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and addictions. However, challenges remain regarding the respective role of psychotherapy, pharmacological effects and subjective experiences in efficacy. This talk will provide a neuroscience perspective on the mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and controversies surrounding psychedelic-assisted therapies, highlighting both their promise and the need for further research.
